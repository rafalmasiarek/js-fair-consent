# Cookie and Tracking Policy

_Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD_

This website implements a privacy-first approach to analytics and tracking, compliant with the **EU GDPR**, the **ePrivacy Directive**, and guidance from the **EDPB** and **CNIL**.

We only collect or store analytics data **after you provide explicit consent** through our cookie banner. Before consent, we operate in **anonymous or “exempt” measurement mode** where applicable (e.g., Umami anonymous, Matomo cookieless).

## Principles
- No non-essential cookies before consent.
- Anonymous measurement may run under legitimate interest where compliant.
- Consent can be **withdrawn at any time**.
- No sale or sharing of personal data for marketing.

## Tools
| Tool | Purpose | Consent | Pre-consent mode |

| Matomo (self-hosted) | Audience measurement | ⚙️ Optional | Cookieless / CNIL “exempt” |
| Umami | Lightweight analytics | ❌ No (anonymous mode) | Anonymous/cookieless |
| Hotjar | UX heatmaps/recordings | ✅ Yes | Not loaded before consent |
| Essential cookies | Auth, prefs, security | ❌ No | Always enabled (essential) |

## Withdrawal

## Legal Basis
